However, there are a few things that have really made this the worse process. 1. It is not disclosed that the dresser is not operational without being mounted to the wall anywhere. I live in a space unable to drill into the wall. 2. I built the entire dresser to find out none of the drawers work properly in the railings. I took out the safety mechanism and they still do not fit. 3. I’ve watched endless YouTube videos, read articles and asked customer support for assistance and no one can help me. I should not have to hire task rabbit just to have this done right. The biggest frustration is all the work it took to put this together, to know how to figure out how to get it back to the store to return. I will never recommend this item or purchase anything from this line again.",
